USER INFO:
This program is a device driver written specifically for Minix 3.1.8 as a 
secret keeping character device. Meaning any user can write to the device
however, once a write has been made to the device, only that user can read
from the device. 

The device can only keep one secret at a time, and has a max character limit
of 8192 characters.

This was created in a virtual Minix 3.1.8 environment, and is not intended
to run outside of said environment.

INSTRUCTIONS:
The provided makefile creates the binary associated with the secret keeper.

Changes to the Minix sources need to be made to support the secret keeper.

More information about the behaviour of the secret keeper can be found in
